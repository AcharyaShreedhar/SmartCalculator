          <h1>The evolution of the calculator</h1>
          <p>
            Most calculators these days require electricity to operate or are
            battery-powered calculators. Calculators work by performing
            programmed functions based on numerical inputs. Before the
            electronic calculator (circa 1970), a more primitive calculator, the
            slide rule, was commonly used. It consisted of a slat of wood called
            the slide that could be moved in and out of a reinforced pair of
            slats. Both the slide and the outer pair of slats had calibrated
            numerical scales.
          </p>

          <h1>Modern calculators</h1>
          <p>
            As calculators became more advanced during the 1970s, they were able
            to make problem-solving computations involving variables (unknowns).
            These were the first personal computers. Additionally, calculators
            have digital versions that can be downloaded or come with most
            smartphone and personal computer operating systems. Today's personal
            computers can still perform such operations, and most are provided
            with a virtual calculator program that looks, on screen, like a
            hand-held calculator. The buttons are actuated by pointing and
            clicking. Theoretically, a modern computer is a calculator that
            works with binary numbers and has a much larger memory. But in the
            practical sense, a computer is far more than a mere calculator
            because of the wide variety of noncomputational tasks it can
            perform.
