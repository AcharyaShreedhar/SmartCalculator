                The age of a person can be counted differently in different
                cultures. This calculator is based on the most common age
                system. In this system, age increases on a person's birthday.
                For example, the age of a person who has lived for 3 years and
                11 months is 3, and their age will increase to 4 on their next
                birthday one month later. Most western countries use this age
                system. In some cultures, age is expressed by counting years
                with or without including the current year. For example, a
                person who is twenty years old is the same age as another person
                who is in their twenty-first year of life. In one of the
                traditional Chinese age systems, people are born at age 1 and
                their age increases up at the Traditional Chinese New Year
                rather than their birthday. For example, if one baby is born
                just one day before the Traditional Chinese New Year, 2 days
                later, the baby will be 2 even though he/she is only 2 days old.
                In some situations, the months and day result of this age
                calculator may be confusing, especially when the starting date
                is the end of a month. For example, we count Feb. 20 to Mar. 20
                to be one month. However, there are two ways to calculate the
                age from Feb. 28, 2022 to Mar. 31, 2022. If we consider Feb. 28
                to Mar. 28 to be one month, then the result is one month and 3
                days. If we consider both Feb. 28 and Mar. 31 as the end of the
                month, then the result is one month. Both calculation results
                are reasonable. Similar situations exist for dates like Apr. 30
                to May 31, May 30 to June 30, etc. The confusion comes from the
                uneven number of days in different months. In our calculations,
                we use the former method.
